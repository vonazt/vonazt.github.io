          <p><span class="drop-character">A</span>ll my life I've enjoyed problem-solving, creativity and culture, so it's not a surprise that as soon as I tried the Python course on Codecademy in late 2017, I became an addict. I loved the way all the pieces tied together, from learning a language and what it's capable of to thinking about different solutions to a problem, building something that works and then making it better. Even if I wasn't planning on working as a web developer, I'd still fill up a lot of my spare time with coding and tinkering on projects.</p>

          <p>I soon completed the Python and Full Stack courses on Codecademy and was hungry for more. I'd found Codecademy useful for learning the basics, but wanted more structured, intensive learning - the idea being to cram in as much as possible in a short space of time to see if I was able to take on a career in coding.</p>

          <p>That's why I enrolled at General Assembly on the Web Development Immersive. It had everything I wanted in terms of the skills it taught and what was expected of me with regard to the amount and quality of work, and I really feel like I thrived on the course. I was constantly challenged in terms of having to learn new things, while also exercising all my creative and problem-solving skills to produce work that I'm proud of (<a href="#portfolio">see my portfolio for more info about my projects</a>). It instilled in me a constant sense of energy and commitment to learning that I’m excited to take into my future career.</p>

          <p>What I enjoyed most from doing the course was, perhaps unsurprisingly, vanilla Javascript. I enjoy the challenge of building an entire app from the ground up and everything that comes with that, from concept to design to UI to testing and all the bits in between, but what I really love the most is getting stuck into the code and finding new tools and techniques for doing what I want to do. I can get lost for hours playing with arrays and objects, rendering data or just completing a challenge on Exercism. That's why, out of all the technologies we used on the course, the one I enjoyed the most was React - because, after working with AngularJS (which I liked) and EJS (which I did not), it felt like getting back to basics, which suited me perfectly.</p>

          <p>In terms of career, my ideal position is to be part of a small, dynamic, socially conscious team working on a variety of hard problems that need solving - I like to be constantly taking on new challenges, learning new skills and using them to be creative and productive. At the moment, I don't have a strong preference for back-end or front-end as I think I have strengths and weaknesses in both, and I'm keen to learn more before potentially specialising further down the line. My main priority over the next year is to learn as much as possible from the people around me, while also doing work that I care about and having fun. Ultimately, this is as a new way of life for me – one that I'm incredibly excited about.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-character">L</span>ong before I'd ever thought about a life of coding, I was studying philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. Philosophy was a brilliant degree for me. It taught me a huge amount in a wide range of topics, from procedural logic to the faculties of human language to aesthetics, political systems and morality. Although there’s not much of a direct link in terms of hard skills between philosophy and coding (apart from logic), I’ve found that the soft skills of analysis, intellectual curiosity and an ability to express thoughts in a concise and meaningful way that I learnt while doing philosophy have been invaluable in coding. Then there are topics such as language processing, consciousness and reasoning that are more relevant to the tech world now than ever.</p>

          <p>But what I really enjoyed doing at university was being part of Bedlam Theatre, the student theatre group. There I spent many hours acting, writing and directing plays with a close group of friends. It was an amazing chance to produce creative work with friends, and spend many years at the Edinburgh Fringe in August, when the city really comes alive.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Thanks to Bedlam Theatre, I went to the <a href="https://www.nsdf.org.uk/" target="_blank">National Student Drama Festival</a> (NSDF), and there I discovered the joys of arts journalism through Noises Off. Noises Off is a magazine published daily at NSDF, full of reviews, comment pieces, jokes and anything else the students at the festival want to put in it. Creating a magazine from scratch every day with a small team was exactly the kind of challenge I love. It meant that I didn't get much sleep over the week, but the satisfaction was always worth it (as was winning the Sunday Times Harold Hobson Student Drama Critic Award – the most ridiculously long-winded award name in the world). Even after leaving university, I kept coming back for more, eventually becoming editor and having to find solutions to the problem of shifting away from print to digital publishing and keeping students engaged.</p>

          <p>It was writing for Noises Off that made me want to be an arts journalist and fiction writer after leaving university. I was lucky enough to get an internship on the Arts Desk of the Financial Times where, among other things, I got to fulfil a fantasy by writing features on <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ecbf8178-7aa0-11e2-9c88-00144feabdc0" target="_blank">drone music gods Earth and Sunn O)))</a>, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9b08c878-2cbf-11e2-9211-00144feabdc0" target="_blank">design in video games</a>. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that the realities of modern publishing made my hopes of living off writing features on obscure topics that interested me and about five other people unlikely to become reality. So I decided to carry on working in editorial, freelancing as a production editor for GQ Style and working as a sub-editor for Times Higher Education, while I committed fully to my much more sensible plan of writing a book.</p>

          <p>It's not like I really believed that within a couple of years I'd be a successful writer, but it was something I felt passionate about, and I knew I'd regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't try. And writing my book, Sleep, taught me a huge amount about self-motivation, dedication to a project, not being scared of a blank page, planning – and also how isolating working alone can be, and how much, ultimately, I enjoy being part of a team and collaborating with other people.</p>

          <p>I really enjoyed writing Sleep, and I'm glad I did it, but just as I was finishing it, I realised that what I was really looking for was a career where I could use all the creativity, imagination and problem-solving skills that I enjoyed most in the work I'd done so far, and be part of an industry that was growing rather than shrinking, where there would be opportunities to be creating the future rather than playing catch up.</p>

          <p>Before I knew it, I'd tried (at the suggestion of my partner) some coding on Codeacademy and knew that this was the life for me.</p>

        <div id="not-coding-about-text">
          <p>As much as I like to relax, I go slightly crazy if I stay still for too long, which is why I like to fill my life with plenty of hobbies and distractions.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-word">BOOKS</span> My first love is reading. I’ll devour any kind of book, but have a particular weakness for postmodern American writers such as David Foster Wallace and Thomas Pynchon. I like to shake up my reading habits - last year I only read books by writers who weren’t white, Western, straight men, along with the first three Harry Potter books in French. This year I’m working my way through the Russian classics (in English!). Discworld novels are my equivalent of comfort food. If I'm not reading fiction, then I like to keep up with current affairs thanks to my LRB subscription, along with Private Eye, the FT and the Guardian - all so I can read about history, art, politics, tech, the future, sport and other places and find out a little bit more about what's going on outside of my own little world.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-word">MUSIC</span> I also have a crippling addiction to vinyl records and add to <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/vonazt/collection" target="_blank">my collection</a> every month. My aim is to create the most eclectic mix possible, ranging from Robert Johnson to Aphex Twin to Led Zeppelin to Wu Tang Clan and everything in between. I can talk about the wonders of drone music for far too long. I also like to hoard songs online and I'm constantly adding to my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/dickpennis/playlist/546C1VqlSpUXRAs0zZQ0jZ?si=gQQazNHwTwaZFyiM93-ZGw" target="_blank">Collectibles playlist on Spotify</a>, which, I think, contains music from every single modern genre. (With a possible exception for nu-metal - I overdid it slightly as a teenager.) I try to get to gigs as often as I can - living in London I feel particularly lucky at the variety of bands I get to see. Recently I've enjoyed the jazz of Kamasi Washington and the face-smashing beats of Run the Jewels.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-word">GAMING</span>A big part of why I enjoy coding, I believe, can be traced back to my love for video games. My first console was the Sega Mega Drive I got when I was 6 – it was the start of a beautiful relationship. I enjoy video games for the same kind of reasons I enjoy coding – the satisfaction of problem-solving and the reward you get from committing to learning a skill. In terms of genres, I'm an absolute sucker for 2D platformers, whether puzzle-platformers such as Braid, indie creepers like Inside, or punishing precision bastards like Celeste and Super Meat Boy. But really I enjoy anything that's going to challenge me and be an enjoyable experience, from the cathartic desert trip of Journey to the fantasy lands of the Witcher, the post-apocalyptic realities of the Last of Us and the rip 'n' tear of DOOM.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-word">PUBS</span>Call me a traditionalist, but I'm a big believer in pubs as social hubs. The first job I got after finishing school was working behind the bar at my local, and it's something I did throughout university and when I first lived in London. I love going meeting people in pubs, sitting with a book, having a good meal or just enjoying a decent beer. In Edinburgh, I worked at <a href="https://www.cloistersbar.com/" target="_blank">Cloisters Bar</a>, where I developed a passion for craft beer and whisky (Lagavulin 16 is absolutely my favourite scotch - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKBTLgTubFw" target="_blank">Ron Swanson and I agree</a> on that). My favourite pub in London is the <a href="http://thesouthamptonarms.co.uk/" target="_blank">Southampton Arms</a>, which is effectively a holy site for lovers of decent boozers and beer. It's not just about the alcohol though! I also enjoy a good pub quiz and regularly tour around North London pubs with a bunch of friends, answering questions and getting frustrated with how little we know.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-word">SPORT</span>Sitting around playing video games, listening to music, reading and drinking beer is, apparently, not the healthiest of lifestyles, so I also try to keep physically active. I run every week and enjoy long cycle rides. In 2014, my partner and I did a sponsored ride from London to Amsterdam in three days, and after graduating from university, I ran my first marathon without any proper training - which was a huge mistake. Watching sport also brings me lots of pleasure - last year I was a season-ticket holder for Saracens Rugby Club and I follow rugby closely, but really any time international sport is on the TV, I'm happy to sit there and pretend like I have an opinion on what's going on.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-word">POKER</span>There was a brief moment a few years ago when I dreamt about becoming a professional poker player. Then I realised two things: it's a full-time job fraught with risk and, more importantly, I wasn't good enough. Still, I love sitting down at a poker table with some friends and playing some Texas Hold 'Em. It's a great combination of skill, competition and luck and I try to play at least once a month. The only problem is it doesn't matter how early you start, heads up will always go until at least 3am...</p>

          <p><span class="drop-character">C</span>heck It was a group project created with two other classmates: <a href="https://biancajemsten.com/">Bianca</a> and <a href="http://martinkoeoep.com/" target="_blank">Martin</a>. The idea came from a practical desire we had to organise group events – Film Club in my case, Dungeons & Dragons in Martin’s – and allow people to vote on which days worked best for them. Our priorities were user experience, test-driven development and building from mobile up. We tried to make the design as clean and intuitive as possible, adding in push and text notifications to alert users when they’ve been invited to an event and when the final dates for an event have been decided.</p>
          <img class="portfolio-gif" src="https://i.imgur.com/t5L4Gha.gif" alt="Check It">
          <p>The app was built using React, utilising Google Places, React Datepicker, React Filestack, Moment.js, React Select Twilio and Web-Push. Working with React for the first time was a really fun challenge – there was a lot to learn about component-based development in a short space of time. We reached MVP relatively early in the process, and one of the the biggest challenges was then spending a couple of days refactoring all our code to make it as efficient, stable and modular as possible.</p>
          <p>Overall, I’m very pleased with how the project went – we achieved what we set out to do in a relatively short space of time, working with a new framework that incorporated a lot of extra functionality. Working in a small team was a great way of solving the trickier problems and also bouncing creative ideas of each other. If I were to do something differently, I’d be more ruthless with myself in terms of refactoring as I go, rather than creating something that works and moving on to the next problem</p>

          <p><span class="drop-character">T</span>all Man Records was a joint project between myself and classmate <a href="http://martinkoeoep.com/" target="_blank">Martin</a>. It is an app that allows users to trade records with each other. Users can upload their own collections, views other users' collections and comment on and review records. The main function allows users to make offers on other records by offering their own. Users can send messages to each other and track the status of each of their trades. Once the trade has been completed, the the owners of the records are swapped in the database.  </p>
          <p>This project included a number of firsts for me. It was my first time using AngularJS, my first time doing pair-programming, and my first time building with a test-driven mindset. Working with AngularJS was enjoyable. I found it relatively easy to get to grips with, the biggest challenge being learning how best to iterate through and render data on the front-end, as well as which parts of the app were best handlded on the back-end. The initial temptation was to do everything on the front-end, and then send it back.</p>

          <p>Having my first taste of pair-programming was probably the most enjoyable part of the project. Working with Martin was easy, and, apart from dividing up the basic building blocks of the back-end, we did most of the coding together on the same laptop. This made tricky parts like creating and editing record trade offers, offer statuses and swapping the record owners in the database much easier, and also meant that we both had a clear idea of what was happening at each part of the stack. We were also very happy to have tested more than 90% of the lines of code in the back-end, and are both big fans of test-driven development.</p>
          <p>If we were to do the project again, we would definitely reconsider how we approached our models. Due to the nature of how the user, record and request models all interact, the more functionality we added to the app, the complicated and convoluted each bit of model interaction became. By the end, there was some pretty gnarly code. But we were pleased with what we managed to accomplish with Tall Man Records in a week, both in terms of the funtionality of the app, its design and its test-driven nature.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-character">W</span>ith Plant Tracker, users can add their plants to a database along with details such as conditions they need to be kept in, the date they were planted and how often the plants need to be watered. Its main feature is a function that tells the user when the plant needs to be watered, which is reset when the user clicks the `Watered` button.</p>
          <p>Plant Tracker was my first time building a full-stack app, which meant that a lot of the initial build was spent familiarising myself with Node.js, the basic principles of RESTful APIs and how an Express app works. There were lots of interesting things to learn, such as user authentication, AWS and the fundamentals of http requests. From the beginning, I had a clear idea of what I wanted the app to do and that the main function of it would be the daysUntilWatering() function that would countdown the number of days since the plant was last watered and remind the user when the plant needed watering.</p>

          <p>Creating this schema method in the end was relatively simple. What wasn't quite so simple was working with EJS Layouts. While I enjoyed learning about how a single view can render multiple instances of the same page using different data, I found the syntax to be quite difficult to use and limited (from a beginner's perspective) in its functionality. It was a great relief after this project was over to move on to the likes of AngularJS, Vue.js and React. That said, it was a good intro to the full-stack world, and I'm happy with how the project turned out. Building something for the first time that came from a practical need and seeing it actually work in action was an extremely satisfying experience.</p>

          <p><span class="drop-character">T</span>he brief for this project was to build a browser-based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript within a week.
          The game I created is Game of Shining Thrones. It is a turn-based strategy game for two players that was inspired by the Shining Force series of games I loved playing as a child (and also from the Game of Thrones series for its aesthetic design).</p>
          <p>Game of Shining Thrones was my first attempt at building an app from the ground up and I loved the process. Looking back on it now, I really went for it in terms trying to achieve a lot of things at once in a week, and this is what led to what I consider to be the project's biggest strengths and weaknesses. In terms of its strengths, it was immensely satisfying thinking my way through the problems of creating a grid, moving characters around that grid, having them attack each and cast magic, creating different characters and their stats, how those stats are affected by attacks, etc. There were a lot of different elements to consider and my response to that challenge was to write a lot of code.</p>
          <img class="portfolio-gif" src="https://i.imgur.com/86KTIYj.gif" alt="Game of Shining Thrones">
          <p>There are nearly 1,000 lines of code in Game of Shining Thrones, and I know now, with the benefit of all that I've learnt since I made this game, that I can probably achieve the same result, with more robustness, in half that many lines, if not more. I've kept the code as it is as a marker of where I started and how much I've learnt in a short space of time. I also think it reflects a central aspect in what I've learnt about myself as a coder: a tendency to overengineer things and then move on to the next challenge instead of being strict with my refactoring. That said, I am proud of how I managed to find solutions to quite complex problems and the fact that I created my first game in just one week.</p>
          <p>It's also the most fun I've ever had incorporating sound effects and music into a project.</p>

          <p>These are the projects I'm currently building, some small things I've cobbled together or code challenges that I'm currently working through.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/vonazt/quiz-app" target="_blank"><span class="drop-word">QUIZ APP</span></a>Still in its early phases, this is an app that will be built using React and use the <a href="https://opentdb.com/api_config.php" target="_blank"></a>Open Trivia Database API for the questions. My aim with this is to build a fun, functional front-end app that will mainly be a chance for me to scratch an itch for an idea I had during the General Assembly Web Development Immersive but wasn't quite appropriate for any of those projects. My goal is to practise refactorting and modularisation, along with making my design as slick and as intuitive as possible. <a href="https://github.com/vonazt/quiz-app" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/vonazt/cinema-finder/tree/master/vue-app" target="_blank"><span class="drop-word">CINEMA FINDER</span></a>Cinema Finder was the end result of a 24-hour hackathon at General Assembly where we were given 24-hours to learn about Vue.js and use it to build something. For the project, I paired up with classmate Bella and we tried to do as much as we could in 24-hours! The project was a great exercise in learning by doing - we had no instruction on how to use Vue.js and instead had to read all the documentation and figure it out by ourselves. The only stipulation was that it had to use the Google Maps API, which is why we decided to create an app where users could input their location and get a populated map of all the cinemas in their area. If the user clicks on the cinema, they then get all the listings for that cinema along with links to books for specific times.</p>
          <p>I enjoyed working with Vue.js and found it a satisfying mix of React's component-driven design and AngularJS-esque syntax. I intend to use it in future projects in order to develop my knowledge of it. In terms of the build, some of the challenges were retaining information such as the user's location across views using the globl scope, and making requests to the cinema listings API in an efficient way, given the limits of the API itself. Overall, I think it was a pretty good effort for 24 hours. <a href="https://github.com/vonazt/cinema-finder/tree/master/vue-app" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/vonazt/exercism" target="_blank"><span class="drop-word">EXERCISM</span></a>I started Exercism immediately after finishing at General Assembly and try to do at least a couple of hours every day, when I'm not also working on my side projects or portfolio. Before GA, I also used Codewars, but am concentrating on Exercism for the moment, as I like being able to use Atom, get comments from mentors, see the tests more directly and the challenges seem to be more in-depth. I always enjoy discovering some of the cool and quirky things JS can do in these challenges, and then working out how to incorporate that knowledge into the things I'm building. <a href="https://github.com/vonazt/exercism" target="_blank">Exercism on Github</a> / <a href="https://exercism.io/profiles/vonazt" target="_blank">Exercism Profile</a>.</p>
          <p><span class="drop-word">PYTHON</span>My coding journey started with Python on Codecademy, and I've no intention of leaving it behind just because I decided to focus on JavaScript and web development. For my birthday a few months ago, my partner bought me the Udemy Python Masterclass, and I'll also be working my way through this in between my personal projects and coding challenges. An important thing for me as a coder is to become familiar with different languages, if only so I'll have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of coding and what other languages can offer.</p>
